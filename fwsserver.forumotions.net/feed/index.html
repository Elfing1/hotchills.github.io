I am here to revive an old topic. About a year ago this guy was banned on -[FWS]- Jail. I am not sure what clearly happened but as I later understood he was banned for freekilling. This time I will teach him the rules myself and I guarantee he won't break rules. His English skills aren't perfect so I will answer all the questions instead of him.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
unfortunately it seems like I am IP banned. Don't know since when, due to the fact I often use VPN service. My usgn is not banned, so I can join the server without problems. Maybe someone banned me by mistake.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Wish you all a good rest weekend

This is my entry for the doghouse mapmaking competition, Krh.

The playable area of the map is about 36x36 tiles, making it a tiny bit bigger than Scrap Land, moving from one corner of the map to the opposite takes around 9 or 10 seconds. Spawns and teams' starting boxes' locations are identical with Scrap Land as well.
