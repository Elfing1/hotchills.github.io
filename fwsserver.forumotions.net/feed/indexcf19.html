First of all,i'm a recently playing on this Server now.It's one of my favorites! 

But the biggest problem is the player "the Coon"

Sometimes he is playing on this server as a CT. He uses like 3-4 connections on this server like:

the Coon (legend)

the Coon (legend) and it's going on.

If you want to play as CT,he will copy himself and votekicking you!

He's also freekilling the whole time and he is racist too.

I want that you ban this player,please.

I'm begging you!

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I bought all "Speed items" but im not fast as other player with all "Speed items".
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe it is a bug.
&lt;br /&gt;
I would appreciate it, if someone could take care of it.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
My Username in CS2D is SniperWolf.
&lt;br /&gt;
But in the Game, you can only see the first part of my Username. It's Sniper.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
With best regards
&lt;br /&gt;

Do you still accept moderators for any of your servers? I am a big fan of prison maps, but unfortunately, the big bane of them is people who either do not understand the rules, don't read them, don't speak English or are just plain assholes. Another thing is that people seem to not know how to votekick - especially the CTs. If terrorists votekick a Ct, nothing happens, anyway.



So I would like to apply as a moderator - surely it cannot be bad to have one more to kick those people?

He began by doing it repeatedly until others began agreeing to vote, reached acontercer 2 times and the second time I thought I will take screenshots.





Would not that punishes severely.
