Ofc, it will be a lot of kids shouting and stuff like that...Maybe in next update each server can let a guy to talk in voice chat I mean, like a group. The Administrator gives permission to playeurs for talking. If you dont have permission, you cant talk. Maybe like !gm in HC//Fun but with voice.

You might also disable "Force Lighting"



Another advise: Download a cs2d 1.0.0.1 version and auto-update it, for me the skins were updated but the gfx were not, meaning I wasn't lagging because of the flashlight for example.



First Step.
