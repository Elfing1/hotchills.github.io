I first began playing cs2d back in 2010 (TGV Deathrun, map's called deathrun_experimentation_lab, was the first server I really liked in case anyone remembers that one), eventually joined the fws community in 2011 to become a moderator on fws's AWP server.

I thaught since Fws is the only server I play on these days, might as well try to join the community of it 



I'm also a mod on the construction and shotgun server.



I love ken and all players, I'm bad tempered sometimes but that's only due to my exams these days!



I'd love to join Fws as a member before anything happens to the servers.
