&lt;br /&gt;
I've been thinking for a while about the moderation of servers and I had an idea. Not that I'm admin or something, I just want to help. So, my suggestion is, what if VIP votes counts as 2 ?
&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, imagine that someone got voted and it is needed 6 votes to the poll be successfully done, but only 4 people voted, the vip vote would do the work.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I really don't know if this is a good idea or not, so yeah, I'm excepting you guys feedback...
&lt;br /&gt;
So, that's it :3</description><category>Servers</category><pubDate>Sat, 20 Sep 2014 15:27:40 GMT</pubDate><comments>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t2159-suggestion-votes#24969</comments></item><item><title>"USGN Only = True"</title><link>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1849-usgn-only-true</link><guid>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1849-usgn-only-true</guid><dc:creator>Rhyno</dc:creator><description>I want to make a suggestion about a particular setting, which can do alot of things.

The particular setting is the "USGN Only?" setting, which can provide benefits for the server security! 



I'm talkin' about the hackers that can their IP, so they can bypass the ban or people that can crash the server, on and on, or even infamous freekiller like Coon which also uses VPN software to bypass the bans. But if we have USGN Only these people are nowadays gone!

I'd like to suggest something for the jail server and it should make things a bit better. My suggestion is: &lt;strong&gt;Teams switch every round&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why? Because everyone can experience being a T or a CT and also freekillers will get what they deserved, lol. That is my suggestion.
&lt;br /&gt;

There are a couple of freekillers on the fws Prison Server that we ban many times a day.

They just restart their router and come back.

As a solution to that, or to make their return a bit hard we could make the server USGN only.

That way they will have to create a new email for that new USGN they'll need every time we ban them.

We could save their IP and ask an Rcon Admin to Range ban them but that could possibly cause other users in with the same internet connection(unlikely  ...</description><category>Servers</category><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2013 21:24:04 GMT</pubDate><comments>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1634-dynamic-ips-freekillers-and-freevoters#19280</comments></item><item><title>-[IFwsI]- Gun Game</title><link>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1610-ifwsi-gun-game</link><guid>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1610-ifwsi-gun-game</guid><dc:creator>Beatzem</dc:creator><description>I'd love Ken make a gun game server. There's a lot of people that love that game mode, including myself. I remember a gun game server from a clan named Storm_PL. It was always full, the thing is, it had Lag Compensation, so people from other countries could enjoy the sv as well.



So.. Like 20-25 levels or more.



Starting with pistols (5 kills each gun)

Then shotguns (3 kills each gun

After Sub Machine guns (5 kills each)

Assault rifles (5 kills)

Sniper rifles(3-5 kills each)

RPG

Laser

Knife(3kills)

We all know that most/all of the servers are empty, so here's a simple idea to solve this problem; we are going to set a specific date/time for all of us to join one of the empty server together to play on it for 30-60 min. (ex : In 7-11-2013 at 06:30 according to "any country's time" we are going to play for 1 hour on Escape maps server ) and so on the other servers in a daily/weekly/monthly specific times.

If you want to announce all users of FWS community that you made a map and you want us to test it before to add it on a FWS server, this is the good topic which you can do that.

Just post here :

- the IP of your server which you opened it to test your map

- the date(s) &amp; the hour(s) when that server is opened

- * the link of the file(s) for that map if we can't get it from your server transfer list or if we can't join your server because the IP is wrong or the server is  ...</description><category>Servers</category><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 17:15:11 GMT</pubDate><comments>http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t1596-testing-maps#18912</comments></item></channel></rss>
