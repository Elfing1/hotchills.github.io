Since the disbandment of Crashzone I've been looking for a clan that would be the same smart and solid one. With it's own special history. After that I was a part of such clans as 474, B.Club, RaWr. But sooner or later they all became inactive. Why do I want to join Fws? It reminds me old good days with cZ» when the game wasn't infected with hackers. Actually this is the second serious decision after cZ» about applying on my way in CS:2D universe.
